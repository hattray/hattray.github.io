<h2><i>My Lost Opportunities - by Stephen Leacock</i></h2>


<p class='cap'>THE other day I took a walk with a
real estate man. Out in the suburbs
he leaned over the wooden
fence of an empty lot and waved
his hand at it.</p>

<p>"There's a lot," he said, "that we sold last
week for half a million dollars."</p>

<p>"Did you really!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "and do you know that
twenty-five years ago you could have picked
that up for fifty thousand!"</p>

<p>"What," I said, "do you mean to say that
I could have had all that beautiful grass and
those mullin stalks for fifty thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"You mean that when I was a student at
college, feeding on four dollars a week, this
opportunity was knocking at the door and I
missed it?"</p>

<p>I turned my head away in bitterness as I
thought of my own folly. Why had I never
happened to walk out this way with fifty thousand
dollars in my pocket and buy all this
beautiful mud?</p>

<p>The real estate man smiled complacently at
my grief.</p>

<p>"I can show you more than that," he said.
"Do you see that big stretch of empty ground
out there past that last fence?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," I said excitedly, "the land with
the beautiful tar-paper shack and the withered
cedar tree,&mdash;the one withered cedar tree,&mdash;standing
in its lonely isolation and seeming to
beckon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say," he said, "was you ever in the real
estate business yourself?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, "but I have a poetic
mind, and I begin to see the poetry, the majesty,
of real estate."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that it," he answered. "Well, that
land out there,&mdash;it's an acre and a half,&mdash;was
sold yesterday for three million dollars!!"</p>

<p>"For what!"</p>

<p>"For three million dollars, cold."

<p>"Not COLD!" I said, "don't tell me it was
cold."</p>

<p>"Yes," went on the real estate man, "and
only three years ago you could have come out
here and had it for a song!"</p>

<p>"For a song!" I repeated.</p>

<p>Just think of it! And I had missed it! With
a voice like mine. If I had known what I
know now, I would have come out to that
land and sung to it all night. I never knew
in the days when I was content with fifteen
dollars a week what a hidden gift my voice
was. I should have taken up land-singing and
made a fortune out of it.</p>

<p>The thought of it saddened me all the way
home: and the talk of the real estate man as
he went made me feel still worse.</p>

<p>He showed me a church that I could have
bought for a hundred thousand and sold now
at half a million for a motor garage. If I
had started buying churches instead of working
on a newspaper, I'd have been rich to-day.</p>

<p>There was a skating rink I could have
bought, and a theatre and a fruit store, a
beautiful little one-story wooden fruit store,
right on a corner, with the darlingest Italian
in it that you ever saw. There was the cutest
little pet of a cow-stable that I could have
turned into an apartment store at a profit of a
million,&mdash;at the time when I was studying
Greek and forgetting it. Oh! the wasted opportunities
of life!</p>

<p>And that evening when I got back to the
club and talked about it at dinner to my business
friends, I found that I had only heard a
small part of it.</p>

<p>Real estate! That's nothing! Why they
told me that fifteen years ago I could have
had all sorts of things,&mdash;trunk line railways,
sugar refineries, silver mines,&mdash;any of
them for a song. When I heard it I was half
glad I hadn't sung for the land. They told
me that there was a time when I could have
bought out the Federal Steel Co. for twenty
million dollars! And I let it go.</p>


<p>The whole Canadian Pacific Railway, they
said, was thrown on the market for fifty millions.
I left it there writhing, and didn't pick
it up. Sheer lack of confidence! I see now
why these men get rich. It's their fine, glorious
confidence, that enables them to write out
a cheque for fifty million dollars and think
nothing of it.</p>

<p>If I wrote a cheque like that, I'd be afraid
of going to Sing Sing. But they aren't, and
so they get what they deserve.</p>

<p>Forty-five years ago,&mdash;a man at the club
told me this with almost a sob in his voice,&mdash;either
Rockefeller or Carnegie could have been
bought clean up for a thousand dollars!</p>

<p>Think of it!</p>

<p>Why didn't my father buy them for me, as
pets, for my birthday and let me keep them
till I grew up?</p>

<p>If I had my life over again, no school or
education for me! Not with all this beautiful
mud and these tar-paper shacks and corner lot
fruit stores lying round! I'd buy out the
whole United States and take a chance, a
sporting chance, on the rise in values.</p>
