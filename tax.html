<H1> Rethinking taxes in response to the discontent in society against the superrich</H1>
<p>
As the saying goes, nothing is certain except death and taxes. Everyone accepts that some form of taxes are unavoidable, no matter where you live. In recent times, there is some discontent in democratic societies - both among policymakers as well as the populace - about how taxation policies of governments seem to be broken allowing the rich corporations and billionaires to get away without paying their fair share. As a result, governments are having to either cut down on welfare spending or be forced to borrow beyond their ability to pay. Any change in the tax policy impacts everyone in some way and for that reason, it is not easy to make wholesome changes to it. This paper is an attempt to understand the weakest links in the current system, which if fixed can have the greatest impact in not just improving the public finances, but also in making the system more equitable without vilifying the rich or killing free enterprise capitalism.

First, a primer. Taxes are mainly categorized as indirect taxes and direct taxes. Indirect taxes are levied at the time of production or delivery of goods and services. As all consumers of a particular good or service pay the same amount of tax, it is seen as fair and hence is not a cause of resentment. Essential goods and services that have mass consumption are typically taxed at a lower rate than those that are considered extravagant or sinful. To encourage higher consumption and economic growth, governments tend to keep indirect taxes at a low level except for items that are not produced locally and put pressure on the exchequer through trade imbalance or loss of forex. Direct taxes are levied on the income and there is a great deal of discourse on the subject. People in the lower and middle-income categories derive their income from regular sources such as salary and often get their income in hand after deduction of taxes. On the other hand, large corporations and high-income individuals have other sources of income such as dividends, capital gains on investments, etc., and deploy legal yet efficient tax planning tools that nullify their taxable income at best or lower their tax rate and defer their incidence of tax at worst.

Unlike in the case of indirect taxes, direct tax rates differ with income levels and, prima facie, it appears that the tax rates increases as the income goes up. But in reality, the effective tax rate works out to be much lower for those in the higher income category. For big corporations, the primary mode of saving taxable income is through incurring capital expenditure by raising debt and offsetting interest costs and depreciation against the profits. As it is better not just for the corporations, but also for the economy as a whole, to invest in the creation of long-term assets, governments condone this behavior allowing some of the largest corporations in the world to pay nil or negligible taxes. In the case of rich individuals, the primary source of wealth is often not high salaries, which are easily taxable, but other means such as inheritance, dividends, long term capital gains on their property or financial investments, or short term capital gains (often seen as speculative or high risk). In most tax jurisdictions, inheritance tax is lower than the tax on dividends, which is lower than the long-term capital gains tax, which is lower than the short-term capital gains tax, which itself is lower than the income tax on regular earnings such as salaries.

Preserving and passing on one's spoils (as well as debts) to their offspring is as old as society itself. The case made for inheritance tax to be the lowest is the conservative thinking that humans are motivated to earn and save for their progeny and governments should have no right to tax when people pass on their wealth to their offspring. Modern society, however,  has already done away with the age-old tradition of passing on the debts of ancestors to the descendants. The passing on of wealth needs to undergo similar reform. Of late, some extremely rich individuals have committed a larger portion of their wealth to philanthropic causes, during and after their lifetimes, than what they have chosen to pass on to their successors. But a democratic and legal wealth redistribution in the form of higher taxes is better than relying on the benevolence of individuals and its trickle effects. Calls have been made to impose an inheritance tax as high as 80% to level the playing field between those born with a silver spoon and those who are not. Society is undergoing tremendous social and demographic changes in the form of lower birth rates and higher divorce rates. A lower birth rate causes a larger portion of ancestral wealth to be shared among fewer inheritors. Thereby, a higher tax rate on inheritance should be palatable if the law enforces it. On the other hand, a higher divorce rate leads to an increase in the number of claimants, in the form of alimony and child care. Though one is inclined to direct the inheritance tax rates to a higher level, one concedes that further study of the impact of higher inheritance tax is needed before it is tampered with.

When an asset or security is bought, held for a duration, and then sold, the gains are taxed and different rates are applied depending on the period over which the gains are made - hence the terms short term and long term capital gains tax. In most countries, short-term capital gains are taxed at a rate significantly higher compared to long-term capital gains. This is presumably to encourage asset owners to hold assets for a longer duration and not transact frequently. Short-term buying and selling are treated as speculating and thus discouraged with higher tax rates. On the other hand, the long-term capital gains tax rate is kept extremely low and this has become the most preferred way of avoiding the incurrence of tax by those in the higher income category. Investors who have the means just continue to hold their investments for several years avoiding paying any taxes on their gains even while the underlying assets inflate greatly due to compounding. This leads to fables of how some of the richest keep getting richer as their assets and net worth appreciate a great deal while their taxable income remains meager, causing resentment in the society. The author's view is that this anomaly needs to be corrected in the tax structure. It is not for the tax policy to favor some investors over others. By bringing the long-term capital gains tax rate on par with the short-term capital gains tax rate, the investment decisions would be made based on the risk appetite and time horizon of the investors and not due to artificial tax savings. Investors who are averse to long-term risks should not be penalized as long as they churn their investments frequently and keep contributing regular taxes to the exchequer.

A just and equitable tax regime will level the playing field for all citizens and in turn, lead to higher compliance and lower resentment. The rich, the poor, and the middle-class are equal participants in society and should bear equal costs in the form of direct tax. The tax structure is kept artificially complex with myriad incentives and penalties for actions with questionable outcomes. The need of the hour is to do away with the complexities and simplify the structure with uniform taxes on different classes of incomes.
